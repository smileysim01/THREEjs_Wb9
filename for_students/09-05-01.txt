Explain why the object you chose is a good use case for environment mapping.

I find my objects suitable. The background object is equirectangular, hence it is appropriate to be set as envMap texture.
The object that captures the texture is a broken mirror. This broken mirror captures the surrounding environment very well.
I have combined envMap and color map to make my object.

Explain where you got your textures and include any attributions here.
