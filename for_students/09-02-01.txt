Explain how you incorporated a material property map here and what its effect is (how can we see it?)

To incorporate the material property map, I first downloaded a tyre texture image from the web.
Then I created a texture object using the TextureLoader class. 
Then, I assigned this texture to the map property of my material(mat).
To make it look more realistic, I also setted the roughness property of the material.

You can see it in the tyre which is rotating in the world. The tyre has grooved texture like any normal car tyre. It looks rough, and shiny just like a real-world tyre.
