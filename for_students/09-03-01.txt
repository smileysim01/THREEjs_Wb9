Explain how you used a normal and bump map above
The leftmost Ball at the back is made using normal map without a colorMap. 
The right Ball at the back is made using bump map without a colorMap. 
The rightmost Ball in the front is made using normal bump with a colorMap. 

After downloading the texture images, I made textures using the TextureLoader class.
I added the image which looks like bumps as normalMap value to the normally mapped ball.
Similarly, I added bumpMap property to the bumppy ball through the same image.
In the third, front ball, I also added a map of a rough orange colored texture image.

Even though I used the same textures for al objects, they all look different.
Clearly, the normally Mapped ball looks like having real texture and apparent bumpiness, whereas the bumpMap ball looks fake.
The third ball with normal mapping and color mapping looks most realistic and not superficially plastic like the other two.
